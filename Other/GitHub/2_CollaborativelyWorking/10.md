Text: 

* 2. If you don’t own a repo and aren’t an official collaborator:

  * you will **fork a repo** - mmm yummy
  * work on your forked copy of the repo 
  * in order to get your changes pulled into the original repo → **make a pull request** for the changes you’ve made
  * the author/owner of the original repo will determine if your changes are cool → and merge them in.
  * Make friends + Big party!
