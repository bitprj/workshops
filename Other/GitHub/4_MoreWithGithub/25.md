Title: Donâ€™t want to license?

Text: 

* You're under no obligation to choose a license.
* It's your right not to include one with your code or project,
* Generally speaking, the absence of a license means that the default copyright laws apply.
* This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that **nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work**. This might not be what you intend.
