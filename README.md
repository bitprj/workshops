# Bit Project - Workshops
All of our workshop materials - open for everyone to use!

Our workshops are first written in Markdown, with one .md file corresponding to a slide. Each card must have the type of slide (please consult our Bit brand template) and appropriate labelings of content to be placed on the slide.
