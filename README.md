# Bit Project - Workshops
All of our workshop materials - open for everyone to use!

Our workshops are first written in Markdown, with one .md file corresponding to a slide. Each card must have the type of slide (please consult our Bit brand template) and appropriate labelings of content to be placed on the slide. 

# How a Slide should Look

This is the format that one Markdown card (or one slide) should utilize:

**Type:** _insert type here_

**Title:** _insert slide title here_

_insert slide content here_

---

_insert any explanations_ (will be in speaker notes)
