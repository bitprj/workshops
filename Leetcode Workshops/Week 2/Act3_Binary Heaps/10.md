> Figure 2: Percolate the New Node up to Its Proper Position (MinHeap with the percUp method)

-----
[for speaker]<> Notice that when we percolate an item up, we are restoring the heap property between the newly added item and the parent. We are also preserving the heap property for any siblings. Of course, **if the newly added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level**. In fact, **we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree while new item is smaller than its parent**.
