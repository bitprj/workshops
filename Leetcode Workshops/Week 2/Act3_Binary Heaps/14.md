> Figure 3: Percolating the Root Node down the Tree (delMin from MinHeaps)


----
[for speaker]<> This shows the series of swaps needed to move the new root node to its proper position in the heap

[for speaker]<> In order to maintain the heap order property, all we need to do is swap the root with its smallest child less than the root. After the initial swap, we may repeat the swapping process with a node and its children until the node is swapped into a position on the tree where it is already less than both children. The code for percolating a node down the tree is found in the `percDown` and `minChild` methods. We are going to introduce `percDown` first.
