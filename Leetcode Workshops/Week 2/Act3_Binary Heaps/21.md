# Binary Heap implementation
```python
bh = BinHeap()
bh.buildHeap([9,6,5,2,3])
```

[for speaker]<> Now with our complete implementation of our Binary Heap (Min Heap)

[for speaker]<> We can now test it out by generating a binary heap and then deleting the minimum element to determine if the functionality of our heap operates properly. Below we will define our binary heap `bh` by calling for the class constructor to intialize our structure. Then we will build our heap by passing in a list of elements.

[for speaker]<> For reference, given the list `[9, 6, 5, 2 ,3]`
