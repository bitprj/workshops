Initial Heap: [9, 6, 5, 2, 3]
                
    i = 2 : [9, 2, 5, 6, 3]
    i = 1 : [2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
    i = 0 : [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

[for speaker]<>To visually interpret how the heap is built, with the above function, the figure will depict how it is built
Figure 4 shows the swaps that the `buildHeap` method makes as it moves the nodes in an initial tree of [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] into their proper positions. 

[for speaker]<> The `percDown` method ensures that the largest child is always moved down the tree and check the next set of children farther down in the tree to ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go.

[for speaker]<> In this case, initial list [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] turned to the list [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]. When **len(aList) = 5; i = len(aList) // 2, i = 2**, a number '2' at the lowest level of the tree swapped with the number '6'. When **i = 1**, the number '2' swapped with the number '9', because 2 is less than 9. Now, the number '2' is located in right position of the heap. The number '9' needed to swap to the lowest level of the tree after the comparison with the number '3'. It results in a swap with the number '3'. Now that the number '9' has been moved to the lowest level of the tree, no further swapping can be done. It is useful to compare the list representation of this series of swaps as shown in [Figure 4]
