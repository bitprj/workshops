# Binary Heap Implementation


```python
class BinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heapList = [0]
        self.currentSize = 0 
```

_____
[for speaker]<> Now to view this programmatically, we will define a Binary Heap implementation representing a Min Heap. We will begin our implementation of a binary heap with the constructor. Since <u>the entire binary heap can be represented by a single list</u>, all the constructor (`__init__`) will do is initialize the list and an attribute `currentSize` to keep track of the current size of the heap. You will notice that an empty binary heap has a single zero as the first element of `heapList` and that this zero is not used, but is there so that simple integer division can be used in later methods.
