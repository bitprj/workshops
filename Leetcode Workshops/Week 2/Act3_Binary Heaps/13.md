# `delMin()`
 - Maintain the heap structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed
   - Taking the last item in the list and moving it to the root position
   - Pushing the new root node down the tree to its proper position.
-----
[for speaker]<> With the `insert` method properly defined, we can now look at the `delMin` method. Since the heap property requires that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree, finding the minimum item is easy. The hard part of `delMin` is restoring full compliance with the heap structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed. We can restore our heap in two steps. First, we will restore the root item by taking the last item in the list and moving it to the root position. Moving the last item maintains our heap structure property. However, we have probably destroyed the heap order property of our binary heap. Second, we will restore the heap order property by pushing the new root node down the tree to its proper position.
