# `buildHeap()`
```python
def buildHeap(self,alist):
    i = len(alist) // 2
    self.currentSize = len(alist)
    self.heapList = [0] + alist[:]
    while (i > 0):
        self.percDown(i)
        i = i - 1
```
- Build the heap in **𝑂(𝑛)** operations
---
[for speaker]<> To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to build an entire heap from a list of keys. The first method you might think of may be like the following. Given a list of keys, you could easily build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are starting with a list of one item, the list is sorted and you could use binary search to find the right position to insert the next key at a cost of approximately **𝑂(log𝑛)** operations. However, remember that inserting an item in the middle of the list may require **𝑂(𝑛)** operations to shift the rest of the list over to make room for the new key. Therefore, to insert 𝑛 keys into the heap would require a total of **𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)** operations. However, if we start with an entire list then we can build the whole heap in **𝑂(𝑛)** operations. Below shows the code to build the entire heap:
