# `insert()`
- Maintain the complete tree property
- Maintain the heap structure property
  - Compare with its parent
  - if less than its parent, then swap

[for speaker]<> The next method we will implement is `insert`. The easiest, and most efficient, way to add an item to a list is to simply append the item to the end of the list. The good news about appending is that it guarantees that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property. However, it is possible to write a method that will allow us to regain the heap structure property by comparing the newly added item with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its parent. The figure below shows the series of swaps needed to percolate the newly added item up to its proper position in the tree
