# `percUp()`

```python
def percUp(self,i):
    while i // 2 > 0: 
      if self.heapList[i] < self.heapList[i // 2]:    
         tmp = self.heapList[i // 2] 
         self.heapList[i // 2] = self.heapList[i]
         self.heapList[i] = tmp 
      i = i // 2  
```
- Percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property. 
-----
[for speaker]<> This depicts the `percUp` method, which percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property. Figure 2 represents the MinHeap (the parent node is less than or equal to the children node) with `percUp` method. MaxHeap (the parent node is greater than or equal to the children node) can be used `percUp` method when the inserting number is greater than the parent node.  Here is where our wasted element in `heapList` is important. Notice that we can compute the parent of any node by using simple integer division. The parent of the current node can be computed by dividing the index of the current node by 2.
