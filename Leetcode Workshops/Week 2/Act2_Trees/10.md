## BST Search:
```Python
def BSTSearch(curNode, key):
    if curNode is None or curNode.key == key:
        return curNode
    if curNode.key < key:
        return BSTSearch(curNode.right, key) #Go right
    else:
        return search(curNode.left, key) #Go left
```
- Go right if you're looking for a larger key or go left if you're looking for a smaller key. 

- It starts at the root and calls the same function again on right child if the desired key is greater than the current node's key 

- If it's not it calls the same function again on its left child if the desired key 

- It returns the current node if the node's key matches the desired key 
- It returns null if it doesn't find a node with a desired key.

[for speaker]: <> (If you know the key to a specific node in a BST and want to access it within your BST, how would you do this? Let's build a function called `BSTSearch` that will allow us to do this.)

[for speaker]: <> (The `BSTSearch` function behaves similarly to how you would if you were looking for a specific key in a BST: go right if you're looking for a larger key or go left if you're looking for a smaller key.)

[for speaker]: <> (It eventually returns the current node being inspected if the node's key matches the desired key or returns null if it doesn't find a node with a desired key. Make sure you understand the code above before moving forward.)
