<!--implement a BST-->

```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.key = key
```

In order to implement a BST in Python, we just need to adjust our previous `Node` class.Since we know that BST nodes only have two children max, we no longer need a list to store the children. We simply store the left child as the **left** element and the right child as the **right** element. In the `Node` class the left and right children are initialized to null.
