## Order the nodes by ID
 ```python
inorderID(r)
inorderName(r)
search(r, 20)
```
- Use inorderID or inorderName function to make the nodes in order by employee ID or employee name.
- We can search the employee name by the key value(employee ID).

[for speaker]: <> (We have inserted all node objects for the root but we have not made them in order by employee ID or employee name. To do so, we use inorderID or inorderName function. Also, we can search the employee name by the key value[employee ID].)
