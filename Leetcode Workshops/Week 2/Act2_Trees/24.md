<!--{title:Define the `Node` class of Family Tree:}-->
## Define the `Node` class of Family Tree:
```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender, sport):
        self.key = name
        self.age = age
        self.gender = gender
        self.sport = sport
        self.children = []
    
    def insert_child(self, newChild):
        self.children.append(newChild)
```
For our family tree, we want to hold the **name**, **age**, **gender**, and **favorite sport** for each member of the family.

* We use key to identify a certain node.
* Assign the name of the family member to be the key

[for speaker]: <> (As you may have noticed, we added arguments to the `Node` class initializer function that we will use to let us store the important data we want to store about each family member. Notice that we are now assigning the name of the family member to be the key that we identify each node as, which is an implementation choice. You could really use any data aspect as the key for each family member. It is just what we will use to identify a certain node.)
