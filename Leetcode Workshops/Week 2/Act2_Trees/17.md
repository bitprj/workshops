## Deleting a BST Node:
* **Two Children Case**: The case when you want to delete a node with two children. 

* When an internal node is deleted, it must be replaced with the maximum node of the deleted node's left subtree or minimum node of the deleted node's right subtree in order to follow the rules of a BST.

[for speaker]: <> (The more challenging case occurs when you want to delete an internal node in the BST, or a node with two children.If you simply deleted the node, you would lose the children.)
[for speaker]: <> (Therefore, when an internal node is deleted, it must be replaced with the maximum node of the deleted node's left subtree or minimum node of the deleted node's right subtree [your code implementation will determine the preference between these two options] in order to still follow the rules of a BST. Here is an illustration that should help your understanding:)
