[for speaker]: <> (In the tree above, the circles with numbers in them are the **nodes** of the tree. The arrows connecting each nodes are the **edges**. The **root** of this tree is the node that contains the number 8. The node containing 3 is a **parent** of the node containing 1. The node containing 1 is a **child** of the node containing 3. The nodes with 4 and 7 are **siblings**. The nodes with 1, 4, 7, and 13 are **leaf nodes**. The nodes containing 8, 3, 10, 6, and 14 are all **internal nodes**. Finally, the group of nodes with values 6, 4, and 7 are a **subtree** of the tree.)
