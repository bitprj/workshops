* **Root Node**: The node with highest hierarchical precedence. Each tree can only have one root node.

* **Parent Node**: The predecessor of a node is called its parent. The root node does not have a parent.

* **Child Node**: The descendant of a node is called its child.

* **Sibling Nodes**: The nodes that have the same parent are called siblings.

* **Leaf Nodes**: A node that does not have a child is called a leaf.

* **Internal Nodes**: A node that has at least one child is called an internal node.
