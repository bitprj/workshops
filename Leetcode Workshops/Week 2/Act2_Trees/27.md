## Connect Susan's children with Susan
```Python
grandma.insert_child(Mary)
grandma.insert_child(Joe)
grandma.insert_child(Don)
```
`grandma.children` will now be a list that holds the node Mary, Joe, and Don. 

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> We have declared node objects for all of Susan's children but we have not indicated in our code that they are her children yet. In order to do so, we can use the `insert_child` function in the `Node` class on Susan's object.

[for speaker]: <> After making those 3 calls, grandma.children will now be a list that holds the node instances mary, joe, and don. We have essentially drawn edges between grandma and mary, grandma and joe, and grandma and don.
