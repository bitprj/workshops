You may be wondering why we would want to use trees. A real life example of a tree structure being used is in ancestry trees. Think of each person in the family as a node. Every person in the family tree is related to other people in the family in some way as a sibling, parent, grandparent, etc. Tree data structures behave in a very similar way as they are both hierarchical structures with nodes, or family members, connected together in a certain manner, and the connection between nodes are there for a specific reason.
