## Tree Terminology:

* **Tree**: Hierarchical structure used to store data elements. Trees have no cycles (connections are one-way and never to previous elements), and are "upside-down" in that the root is at the top and leaves are at the bottom.

* **Node**: Each individual data element of the tree that is linked to other data elements within the tree. Identified by a key.

* **Edge**: Link that connects two nodes.

* **Level**: The number of parent nodes that a given node has. For instance, the root node has 0 parents so it is at Level 0. It's children are at Level 1, grandchildren at Level 2, and so on.

* **Subtree**: A grouping of connected nodes within the tree.
