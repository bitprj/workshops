## Time Complexity of `BSTInsert` :

Similarly to `BSTSearch`, the worst-case scenario runtime for `BSTInsert` is also **O(n)**. The worst-case would occur when you have to go through every node in the tree to find the proper place to insert the node.

<!--Let's use the same example from the previous card to illustrate this:-->

In order to insert `60` into this tree, we needed to visit every other node first. Hence, this was a worst-case scenario.
