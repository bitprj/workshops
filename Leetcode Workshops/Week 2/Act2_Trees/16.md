When deleting a BST node, there are **two main cases**:

* **Leaf/One Child Case:** The first case is when the node we want to delete is a leaf in the BST or a node with only one child.

[for speaker]: <> (The last fundamental function that allows us to interact with BSTs is `BSTDelete`, which will allow us to remove unwanted nodes from our tree. `BSTDelete` is arguably the most complicated of the BST functions we have learned so far because we have to fix the tree once we remove a node.)

[for speaker]: <> (Since a leaf does not have any children, deleting it from a BST leaves us with a proper BST, meaning we do not have to change the structure of the tree and can simply remove the node. Also, if a node we want to delete only has one child, we can just delete that node and place its child where it used to be. Here is an example of the former:)
