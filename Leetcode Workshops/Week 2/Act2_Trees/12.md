## Time Complexity of `BSTSearch`:

* Searching for the node with key 50.

* The time to reach a desired node would be O(height)

* In this worst-case scenario, it would be **O(n)**, with **n** being the amount of nodes in the tree.

* The time complexity of `BSTSearch` is **= O(n)**

[for speaker]: <> (Since we're interested in finding the asymptotic time in the **worst-case**, we must consider what the worst case situation would be when searching for a node.)
[for speaker]: <> (The diagram depicts the worst-case scenario when searching for the node with key 50. As you can see, the time to reach a desired node would be O[height], and in this worst-case scenario, it would be O[n], with n being the amount of nodes in the tree, since you have to search through every node in the tree.)

[for speaker]: <> (Thus, the time complexity of `BSTSearch` is O[n])
