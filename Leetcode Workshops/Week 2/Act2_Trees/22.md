## `BSTDelete()`
```python
        #Internal Node Case:
        tempNode = smallestNode(curNode.right) #find smallest key node of right subtree
        curNode.key = tempNode.key
        curNode.right = BSTDelete(curNode.right, tempNode.key)
```
### Step4: deal with case2
* Find its in-order predecessor node.
* Replace its value with the predecessor's value.
* Delete the predecessor node from our tree.

[for speaker]: <> (Although `BSTDelete` seems complicated initially,you will realize that it simply follows the logic of either the **Leaf/1 Child Case** or the **Internal Node Case**. Feel free to ask questions about the two cases if you're having trouble understanding the `BSTDelete` code.)
