## Binary Trees:

A **Binary Tree** is a tree where every single node can only have zero, one, or two children.

The **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special kind of Binary Tree. 

* Every element in the left subtree of a node has keys that are lesser in value than the key of that particular node.

* Every element in the right subtree of a node has keys that are greater in value than the key of that particular node.

[for speaker]: <> (A simple tree structure is fundamental, but let's investigate a specific type of tree that allowsfor an interesting and structured way to store data.The tree structure we will be dealing with, however, is a special kind of Binary Tree, the Binary Search Tree have a few more restrictions)
