* Find the *maximum* value of a node's *left* subtree, which is `19`.
* Replace 20 with 19
* What if we want to delete the root 15?

[for speaker]: <> (As you can see, we chose to delete `20` from the tree, and picked its in-order predecessor node as its replacement. The in-order predecessor node is the maximum value of a node's left subtree, in this case, `19`.. Similarly, we could have also used the in-order *successor* node, which is the *minimum* value of a node's *right* sub-tree. If we had gone that direction, we would have chosen `30` as the replacement for `20` in our example instead. )

[for speaker]: <> (Note that the process for deleting a child with two nodes is the same for **any** node, even the root! If we had decided to remove `15` from our tree above, and still decided to use the in-order predecessor node as our replacement, we would have picked `12` to be in its place. We would have chosen `16` if we picked the successor node.)
