```python
class Node: 
    def __init__(self,key,name): 
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key
        self.employeeName = name
```
- We want to hold each employee's ID number(Key) and name.

[for speaker]: <> (We added arguments to the `Node` class initializer function that we will use to let us store the important data we want to store about each employee's ID number[Key] and name.)

[for speaker]: <> (For our employee information tree, we weant to hold the key, and **name** for each employee of the company.Therefore, we must slightly modify our 'Node' class to allow us to encompass that data.)

[for speaker]: <> (We are now assigning the name of the employee to be the key that we identify each node as, which is an implementation choice. You could really use any data aspect as the key for each employee. It is just what we will use to identify a certain node.)
