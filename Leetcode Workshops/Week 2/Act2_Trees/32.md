<!--title={Real Life Application of Binary Search Tree}-->

- Consider that we are admins for a corporation that has many employees and we must have some sort of way to keep track of each employee in our database system. 

- We need an efficient way of **searching** for particular employees based on their **employee identification number**. 

- Each employee has a distinct identification number, so we will use a Binary Search Tree as our structure that stores the employees' ID numbers which represent the nodes.
