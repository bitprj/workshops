## `BSTDelete()`
```Python
def smallestNode(curNode):
    inspectedNode = curNode
    while(inspectedNode.left is not None):
        inspectedNode = inspectedNode.left  #Go left as far as possible
    return inspectedNode
```
### Step1: define helper function
* Define a function which finds the smallest node in a given node's subtree. 

* It traverses down the node's left subtree, always choosing to visit the left child, until we reach a leaf.

* That leaf node is the smallest node and gets returned.

[for speaker]: <> (Due to the various cases when deleting a BST node, the `BSTDelete` function is a little more complex than `BSTSearch` and `BSTInsert`. However, don't be intimidated by the code; make certain you understand the process of deleting a node, because the code simply follows that logic. Let's take a look:)

[for speaker]: <> (This is a helper function which will allows us to find the smallest node in a given node's subtree. The process is simple. We simply traverse down the node's left subtree, always choosing to visit the left child, until we reach a leaf. That leaf node is the smallest node and gets returned. As you can tell, we are chooisng the in-order predecessor node as our replacement in this code implementation.)
