_**title:`BSTDelete()`**_
## `BSTDelete()`
```python
else:  #found node to be deleted
        if curNode.left is None:  #Case 1
            tempNode = curNode.right
            curNode = None  #Delete node
            return tempNode
        elif curNode.right is None:  #Case 1
            tempNode = curNode.left
            curNode = None  #Delete node
            return tempNode
```
###  Step3: deal with case 1.
We "delete" a node by setting it to `None`.

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> Here, we found the node and it falls under one of the two situations listed in Case 1: it is either a leaf, or only has one child. We do the appropriate replacement and deletion procedures. Notice that we "delete" a node by setting it to `None`.
