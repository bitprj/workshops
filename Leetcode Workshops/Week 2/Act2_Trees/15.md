## Time Complexity of `BSTInsert` :

In order to insert `60` into this tree, we needed to visit all the other nodes in the tree first. 

Similarly to `BSTSearch`, the time complexity of `BSTInsert`is also **O(n)**.

[for speaker]: <> Let's use the same example from the previous slide to illustrate this

[for speaker]: <> Similarly to `BSTSearch`, the worst-case scenario runtime for `BSTInsert` is also O[n]. The worst-case would occur when you have to go through every node in the tree to find the proper place to insert the node.
