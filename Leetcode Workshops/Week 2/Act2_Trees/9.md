_**title:Implement BST `Node` class BST**_

## Implement BST `Node` class BST
```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.key = key
```

 We store the left child as the **left** element and the right child as the **right** element. The left and right child are initialized to null.

[for speaker]: <> In order to implement a BST in Python, we just need to adjust our previous `Node` class.Since we know that BST nodes only have two children max, we no longer need a list to store the children.
