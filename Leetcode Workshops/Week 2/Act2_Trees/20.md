## `BSTDelete()`
```python
def BSTDelete(curNode, key):
    if curNode is None:
        return curNode
    if (key < curNode.key):
        curNode.left = BSTDelete(curNode.left, key)
    elif (key > curNode.key):
        curNode.right = BSTDelete(curNode.right, key)
```
### Step2: find the node that we want to delete

We traverse down the left and right subtree of any given node until we reach the node we are looking to delete.

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> (In order to delete a node, we need to find it first! This process is the exact same as with `BSTSearch` and `BSTInsert`. We traverse down the left and right subtree of any given node until we reach the node we are looking to delete.)
