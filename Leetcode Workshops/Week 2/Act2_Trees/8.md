## Binary Trees:

A simple tree structure is fundamental, but let's investigate a specific type of tree that allows for an interesting and structured way to store data. A **Binary Tree** is a tree where every single node can only have zero, one, or two children.  The tree structure we will be dealing with, however, is a special kind of Binary Tree, the **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. **BST**s have a few more restrictions:

* Every element in the left subtree of a node has keys that are lesser in value than the key of that particular node.

* Every element in the right subtree of a node has keys that are greater in value than the key of that particular node.
