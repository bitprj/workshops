## `delete()` 
```python
    while current and found is False:
        if current.get_data() == data:
            found = True
        else:
            previous = current
            current = current.get_next()
```

- Go through the list until it arrives to the node that it wants to delete. 

- When it find the node, it resets previous node's `next_node` to point at the node that the deleted node is pointing at.

[for speaker]: <> (In order to delete an element, the `delete[]` function goes through the list until it arrives to the node that it wants to delete. When it arrives, it takes a look at the previous node it visited and resets that node's `next_node` to point at the node that comes after the one to be deleted.)
