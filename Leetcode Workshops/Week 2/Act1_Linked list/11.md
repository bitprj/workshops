_**title:`insert()`**_
## `insert()`
```python
def insert(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.set_next(self.head)
    self.head = new_node
```
- Initialize a new `Node` object with the data
- Make the `Node` points to the old head
- Set `Node` to be the new head
- Time complexity : O(1)

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> To begin inserting new nodes into the linked list, we'll create an `insert[]` method! We will take data, initialize a new `Node` object with the data, then add it to the list. Although its possible to insert a new Node anywhere in the list, it becomes less expensive to insert it at the beginning.

[for speaker]: <> If we had a string of pearls and wanted to add a new pearl, we would add the pearl at the start of the string, making our new pearl the "head" pearl. In the same sense, when inserting the new Node at the beginning, it becomes the new "head" of the list, and we can just have the next node [for our new "head"] to point to the old "head" Node.

[for speaker]: <> Upon further observation, we can see that the time complexity for this insert method is in fact constant O[1]: it always takes the same amount of time. It can only take one data point, create only one node, and doesn't need to interact with the other nodes in the linked list besides the "head" node.
