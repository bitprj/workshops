## `size()`

```python
def size(self):
    current = self.head
    count = 0
    while current:
        count += 1
        current = current.get_next()
    return count
```
- `size()` return the amount of nodes it found.
- Begin with the "head" node 
- Go to the next node and increase the count
- Stop when `current` node becomes None
- The time complexity is O(n)

[for speaker]: <> (In order to find the size of a linked list, we can define our `size[]` function as being able to count nodes until it doesn't find any more, and return the amount of nodes it found.)

[for speaker]: <> (The method begins with the "head" node and travels through the list using the `next_node` pointers to reach the next node until the `current` node becomes None. Once it reaches that point, it will return the number of nodes that it encountered along the way.)

[for speaker]: <> (The time complexity of size is O[n] because each time the method is called it will always visit every node in the list but only interact with them once, so n * 1 operations.)
