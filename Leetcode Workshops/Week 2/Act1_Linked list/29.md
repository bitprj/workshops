##  Step2:
### One way: creating a new node and setting it as the next node following the previous node

```python
node1 = Node(930)
node2 = Node(1000)
film.head.set_next(node1)
node1.set_next(node2)
```

> Note: *node1* and *node2* are new nodes that represent two more scheduled auditions for our Linked List *film* that follow the head node. 


-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> Since the first node in our Linked List is the head, we then call `film.head.set_next[node1]` in order to assign `node1` as the next node following the head. 
 Now that `node1` is the tail of our Linked List `film`, we next call `node1.set_next[node2]` in order to assign `node2` as the next node following the tail, `node1`.
