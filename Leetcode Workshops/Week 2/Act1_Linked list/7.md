## class LinkedList
```python
class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
```
- The "head" node is set to None

[for speaker]: <> (Now, we can create the start of our linked list! Luckily, the linked list (as a class) itself is actually the "head" node of the list!)
[for speaker]: <> (Note: Upon initialization, a list has no nodes, so the "head" node is set to None. Because a linked list doesn't necessarily need a node to initialized, the "head" node will, by default, set itself to None.)
