- The "head" node is the very first node in the list. 
- Each node contains two things: some data associated with the node, and a reference to the next node in the list.

[for speaker]: <> To put it in the simplest terms, one can think of a linked list like a string of pearls. Each pearl in the string leads to the next. The first pearl on the string can be called the "head" pearl. In a linked list, the "head" node, as can be assumed, is the very first node in the list. Each node contains two things: some data associated with the node, and a reference to the next node in the list.
