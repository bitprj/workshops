| -------- | --------------------- | :-------------------- |
| current  | node with data '1000' | node with data '930'  |
| previous | None                  | node with data '1000' |
| found    | False                 | True                  |

[for speaker]: <> In our `main[]` function later on, deleting a node from a linked list will look like this

[for speaker]: <> We began looking for the node we want to delete from our head [the node with data '1000'].  We found that it's not holding the data we were looking for. So, we go to the next node. At the same time we update the current node and previous node. In this example, we find data '930' in our second step. We set our pervious node points to the node that current node is pointing at. Thus, after deletion the node with '1000' now points at the node with '900' instead of the node with '930.'
