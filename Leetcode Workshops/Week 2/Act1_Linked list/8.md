## Implement the `Node` class

```python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = None
```
- Node is where data is stored in the linked list.

- Each node also holds a **pointer** which is a reference to the next node in the list.

[for speaker]: <> (It's a simple implementation of a `Node` class [a representation of the `Node` objects in a linked list].)

[for speaker]: <> (The node is where data is stored in the linked list; if a pearl was hollow and contained a bead inside, the bead would be the data. Along with the data, each node also holds a pointer which is a reference to the next node in the list. Note: if it was a doubly linked list, the reference to the previous node would be a pointer too.) 

[for speaker]: <> (The node's data is initialized with data received at creation, and its pointer is set to None by default since the first node to be inserted into the will wouldn't have any other node to point to.)

[for speaker]: <> (Each `Node` object contains data that can be retrieved via the `get_data` function and can get or set the next node via the functions `get_next` and `set_next` respectively.)
