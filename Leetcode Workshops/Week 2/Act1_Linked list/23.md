## `search()`
```python
    if current is None:
        raise ValueError("Data not in list")
    return current
```
- If data is not in the list
- Time complexity is O(N)

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> Should the function not find the data at all, it will return an error notifying the user that the data is not in the list. Note: If the function goes through the entire list without finding the data, that is also our worst-case scenario, meaning our worst-case time complexity is O[N].

[for speaker]: <> Now, if we want to find a certain node in our linked list, we can use a search method!
