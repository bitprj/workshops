_**title: Advantages and Disadvantages of Linked list**_

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Linked list
### Advantages 
- Dynamic memory allocation
### Disadvantages
- Use more space
- In order to access the item in the middle, you have to start from the head node
- Some insertion cost more space

-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> Many benefits come with using a linked list instead of any other similar data structure [like a static array]. This includes dynamic memory allocation--if one doesn't know the amount of data they want to store during initialization, a linked list can help with quickly adjusting the size of the list.

[for speaker]: <> However, there are also several disadvantages to using a linked list. More space is used when dyanmically allocating memory [mostly for the reference to the next node], and if you want to access an item in the middle, you have to start at the "head" node and follow the references until reaching the item wanted.

[for speaker]: <> In practice, some insertions cost more. If the list initially allocates enough space for six nodes, inserting a seventh means the list has to double its space [up to 12].
