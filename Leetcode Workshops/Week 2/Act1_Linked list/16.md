_**title:delete()**_
## `delete()` 
```python
    if current is None:
        raise ValueError("Data not in list")
    if previous is None:
        self.head = current.get_next()
    else:
        previous.set_next(current.get_next())

```
- If the data is not in the list
- If we are at the `head` node
- Delete current node by setting previous node's `next_node` points at current node's `next_node`


-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> Afterwards, we add several statements in the case that the data doesn't exist in the list, moving onto the next node if we're at the "head" node, and moving through the list node by node.

[for speaker]: <> When the previous node's `next_node` points at the next node in line, then no nodes will point at the current node, meaning that the current node has now been deleted!
