## Check whether we removed the cancelled appointments

```python
print(film.search(1000))
print(film.search(1230))
```
- Use `search()`
- If removed, it will return data not found
- We can also use `size()` to double check
-------------------------------------------------

[for speaker]: <> (To confirm that we have removed the canceled appointments, we will check that the corresponding nodes were deleted from our Linked List by searching for them)

[for speaker]: <> (Note: The first `search[]` function looking for the data point of 10:00 should return an error stating the data was not found [since the node has been deleted]. The same should happen for the 12:30 node.)

[for speaker]: <> (To double check, we can also check again using the size[] function to identify that `film` now only contains 6 nodes in this order: 9:00, 9:30, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00.)
