[for speaker]: <> (In a singly linked list, each node [or pearl] has one single reference to the next node [or pearl]s in the list. A doubly linked list instead has two references, one for the next node, and one for the previous node. The last node in all linked lists points to a "null" node, signfying the end of the list.)
