### Title: What's a Stack? ###

- A stack is a data structure that adds elements to the front of the list.

- How this data structure works is that earliest elements that are added into the stack will be on the bottom of the stack
  and the most recent element that is on the stack will get removed first.
  
- This process is called LIFO (Last in, First out).
