### Title: What's a Stack? ###

- A stack is a data structure that adds elements to the front of the list.

- How this data structure works is that earliest elements that are added into the stack will be on the bottom of the stack
  and the most recent element that is on the stack will get removed first.
  
- This process is called LIFO (Last in, Last out).

- An example can be a stack of books. Say that you have a huge stack of books at the library and you want to access your Calculus
  textbook that's below your Physics, Circuts, and Chemistry textbooks.
  
- This is where you get to see the wonderful implementation of using a stack.

- You would remove the most recent book that's on top of your stack (this is what we call popping an item into a stack) in order until
  you can access your textbook.
  
- Congratulations! You can now work on those wonderful triple integrals that you have to do for your homework :`)

- After finishing your homework, you can put your textbooks back on top of your calculus textbook (this is what we call pushing an
  an item into a stack).
