**Title:** Collision Resolution Techniques

_insert slide content here_

The pupose of a hash table is to assign each key to a unique slot, but sometimes it is possible that two keys will generate an identical hash causing both keys to point to the same slots. They are known as **hash collisions**. 

> A bucket is simply a fast-access location (like an array index) that is the the result of the hash function.

The figure shows incidences of **collisions** in different table locations. We'll assign strings as our input data: `[John, Janet, Mary, Martha, Claire, Jacob, and Philip]`. 

Our hash table size is 6. As the strings are evaluated at input through the hash functions, they are assigned index keys `(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)`. We store the first string `John`, then `Janet` and `Mary`. All is fine, but when we try to store `Martha`, the hash function assigns `Martha` the same index key as `Janet`. 

Now, because a second value is attempting to map to an already occupied index key, a **collision** occurs as seen in figure we've been using. Three out of the six locations are occupied, and the probability that the remaining strings yet to be loaded will cause other **collisions** is very high.



So we now return to the problem of collisions. When two items hash to the same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item in the hash table. This process is called **collision resolution**. 



### How to handle Collisions?

There are mainly two methods to handle collision:

- 1) Separate Chaining
- 2) Open Addressing

We will elaborate further on these concepts in the following cards.
