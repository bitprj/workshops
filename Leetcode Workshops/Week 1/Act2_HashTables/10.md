**Title:** Hash Tables in Python

As you now know, Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

So the search and insertion function of a data element becomes much faster as the key values themselves become the index of the array which stores the data.

However, when we talk about **hash tables**, we're actually talking about a **dictionary**. In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary satisfy the following requirements.

- The keys of the dictionary are hashable i.e. the are generated by hashing function which generates unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.
- The order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed.

Dictionaries in python are implemented through Hashtables. Dictionaries won't be covered extensively in this activity, but this an interesting piece of information to take note of.
