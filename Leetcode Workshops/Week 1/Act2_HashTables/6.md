**Title:** Advantages and disadvantages of seprate chaining

_insert slide content here_

### Advantages:

1) Simple to implement.
2) Hash table never fills up, we can always add more elements to the chain.
3) Less sensitive to the hash function or load factors. 
4) It is mostly used when it is unknown how many and how frequently keys may be inserted or deleted.

> A load factor is simply the ratio of entires in hash table to size of the array

### Disadvantages:

1) Cache performance of chaining is not good as keys are stored using a linked list. Open addressing provides better cache performance as everything is stored in the same table.
2) Wastage of Space (Some Parts of hash table are never used)
3) If the chain becomes long, then search time can become O(n) in the worst case.
4) Uses extra space for links.
