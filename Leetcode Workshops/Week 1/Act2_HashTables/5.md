**Title:** Seprate Chaining

_insert slide content here_



In this card, we will exploring a methodk nown as **separate chaining** which is an essential part of Data Structures. 
In the method known as **separate chaining**, each bucket is independent, and has some sort of **list** of entries with the same index. In other words, it's defined as a method by which lists of values are built in association with each location within the hash table when a collision occurs.

As each index key is built with a linked list, this means that the table's cells have linked lists governed by the same hash function. So, in place of the collision error which occurred in the figure we used in the last section, the cell now contains a linked list containing the string 'Janet' and 'Martha' as seen in this new figure. We can see in this figure how the subsequent strings are loaded using the separate chaining technique.
