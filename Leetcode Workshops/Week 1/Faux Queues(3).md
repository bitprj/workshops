### Title: Implementing a Queue ###

- We're going to make a Queue class to show how the Queue itself works.

- The first step would be to create our queue constructor in which we start our queue off as an empty list for adding items

```python

class Queue:
    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
       self.queue=[]
```
