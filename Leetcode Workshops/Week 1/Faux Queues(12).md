### Type of Card: Code left/right ###

-This is where you can implement the deque() properly when youâ€™re dequeuing elements. For deque, you would use the popleft() function to delete elements in the front of the list (the version of deleting elements from the rear is popright()).

```python
# Dequeuing elements from the Queue
queue.popleft() #[5,8,9,7,0]
queue.popleft() #[8,7,9,0]
```
