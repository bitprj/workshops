### Type of Card: Code left/right ###

-Let's say that the total number of passengers is 50 people. Let's add each passenger in the plane using the enqueue() call
   to fill up the number of spots available.
   
```python
passengers = 50 #Total of the current 50 passengers on the plane
boardingPlane = Queue()
int(passengers) = 50

for x in range(passengers):
	boardingPlane.enqueue(x)
  
print(boardingPlane.size()) #result prints a size of 50
```
