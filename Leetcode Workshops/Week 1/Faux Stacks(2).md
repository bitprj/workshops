### A Real-Life Example of a Stack ###

- An example can be a stack of books. Say that you have a huge stack of books at the library and you want to access your Calculus
  textbook that's below your Physics, Circuits, and Chemistry textbooks.
  
- This is where you get to see the wonderful implementation of using a stack.

- You would remove the most recent book that's on top of your stack (this is what we call popping an item into a stack) in order until
  you can access your textbook.
  
- Congratulations! You can now work on those wonderful triple integrals that you have to do for your homework :`)

- After finishing your homework, you can put your textbooks back on top of your calculus textbook (this is what we call pushing an
  an item into a stack).
