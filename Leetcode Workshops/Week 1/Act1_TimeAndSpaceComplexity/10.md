**Title:** Big Omega and Big theta 

### Big Omega

Similar to **Big (O)**, we also have **Big Omega**. **Big Omega** is just the opposite; it is the lower bound of our function. 

Let's look at our chocolate example again. The same conditions hold true. We can establish the lower bound of how much chocolate you have to be 3/4. Why is this a valid lower bound? Because you will eventually exceed having 3/4 of the chocolate. **Remember when looking for bounds, we want one that holds true after a certain point and not necessarily from the beginning.**   

In terms of Python, let's say we have a `functionC` that runs on **O(n)** time. If we have `functionC` which grows on **O(n)** time, that would function as the **Big Omega** for our function, `functionA`. 

[//]: # "insert 'functionC vs functionA' image"

`functionA`'s runtime grows faster than `functionC` after a certain point. After that certain point, we know with absolute certainty that the runtime of `functionA` will never be faster than `functionC`. 

### Big Theta

Lastly, we have **Big Theta**. Big Theta is simply **Big O**'s formal name. **Big Theta** is the average runtime of a function. Going back to when we were determining the **Big O** notation for a function, we would write each line in the function in **Big O notation**. 

For example,

$$
Time(Input) = O(1) + O(n) + O(1). 
$$


We then dropped every term except the fastest growing term (**O(n)**), and made that term define the function. By dropping all the terms, we are estimating the runtime of the function and finding our **Big Theta**.
