**Title:** _In what time does a function grow?_

Content:

```python
value = range(6)

def three(value):
    sum = 0				#c1
    return(sum)		#c2
```

`sum = 0` only repeats once, so we know this line will take a constant amount of time **c1**. `return(sum)` also only repeats once, so we can infer that this line carries out in constant time **c2**.

Hence, we predict that `three()` grows in **constant time**.

**_code 1 explained_**

Our prediction is true. Since both lines take constant time, adding them up is also still constant time, and our graph looks like a straight line.
