Example 2:

Let's look at the function `three` again. We can treat *c1 + c2* as one constant and call it **c3**. Now we have `T(I) = c3`. This makes it very obvious that the runtime of `three()` is *constant*.

```python
value = range(6)
def three(value):
    sum = 0						#c1
    return(sum)				#c2
```

Example 3:

Let's do the same for `listInList()`.Putting it into a function, we get `Time(Input) = n^2 + c1 + c2`. If we isolate the fastest growing term, we get `T(I) = n^2` which reveals the runtime to be *quadratic*.

```python
keypad = [[1, 2, 3], 
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9],
          [0]] 
def listInList(keypad):
    sum = 0							#c1
    for row in keypad:`
        for i in row:		#n^2
            sum += i
    return sum					#c2
```
