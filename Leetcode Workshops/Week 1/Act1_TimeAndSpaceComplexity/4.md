**Title:** How can we tell the time complexity just from the function?

**Content:**

 To summarize briefly so far, the time of an algorithm or function's run time will be the sum of the time it takes for all the lines in the code of the algorithm to run. This runtime growth can be written as a function. 

We can use the fastest growing term to determine the behavior of the equation; in this case, it is the **c2 * n** term. If we simply look at `Time(Input) = c2*n`, we know easily that the function is linear and that the runtime of `valueSum()` is *linear*.

```python
value = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def valueSum(value):
	sum = 0								#c1
	for i in value:				#n*c2
    	sum = sum + i
    return sum					#c3
```

Remember that elementary functions such as  `+, -, *, \, =` always take a constant amount of time to run. **Thus, when we see these functions, we assign them the value *c* time.** 

From before, we analyzed `valueSum()` line by line and got `f(n) = c2*n + c1 + c3` when we added everything. This equation is actually a function of time where *n* is the input size and *f(n)* is the runtime; we can treat *f(n)* as *Time(Input)*.
