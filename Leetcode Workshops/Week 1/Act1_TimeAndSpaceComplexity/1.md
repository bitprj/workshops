**Time complexity** allows us to describe **how the time taken to run a function grows as the size of the input of the function grows.**

In our function, `valueSum()`. The amount of time this function takes to run (execution time) will grow as the number of elements (n) in the array increase. If the elements in the array `value` went up to 1,000,000, the amount of the time it would take for the function to compute would be much higher than if the array only went up to 10. 

```
value = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

def valueSum(value):
    sum = 0					 		#c1 runtime
    for i in value:
        sum = sum + i		#c2 runtime
    return sum					#c3 runtime
```

Adding all the individual runtimes, we'll get `f(n) = c2*n + c1 + c3`. Look familiar? It's in the form of a linear equation `f(n) = a*n + b` where a and b are constants. We can predict that `valueSum()` grows in linear time.

Here it is linear -->

_Explanation of code 1_

`sum = 0` runs in constant time as it is simply assigning a value to the variable `sum` and only occurs once. For this line, the runtime is **c1**.

The for loop statement expresses a variable `i` iterating over each element in `value`. This creates a loop that will iterate *n* times since `value` contains *n* elements.

`sum = sum + i` occurs in constant time as well. Let's say this line runs in *c2* time. Since the loop body repeats however many times the loop is iterated, we can multiply *c2* by *n*. Now we have **c2 \* n** for the runtime of the entire for loop.

Lastly, `return sum` is simply returning a number and only happens once. So, this line also runs in constant time which we'll note as **c3**.

Time complexity answers the question: "At what rate does the time increase for a function as the input increases". **However**, it does not answer the question, "How long does it take for a function to compute?",  because the answer relies on hardware, language, etc.

For time complexity, functions can grow in **constant time**, **linear time**, **quadratic time**, and so on.
