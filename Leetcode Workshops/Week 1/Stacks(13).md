### Title: The Tower of Hanoi ###

- The tower of Hanoi is a puzzle in which you have 3 poles and 3 disks of different sizes. You'll always start with the largest disk
  on the bottom of the 1st pole and the smallest disk on the top of the 1st pole
  
- The goal is to see if we can sort the stack of disks in their original order by the time you stack the disks on the 3rd pole.

- The rule of the puzzle is that you can't place a larger disk on a smaller disk and only one disk can be moved at a time.

- In order to solve this puzzle, we need to use our good old friend, the stack class since the stack algorithm can remove the latest
  item that was on top of the list and sort it into another pole into the proper order.
