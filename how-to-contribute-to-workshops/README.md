# Workshops

## Purpose

Bit Project implements workshops in order to help students, regardless of their level of technical knowledge, develop pertinent skills and learn new technologies. 

## Workshop Format

These workshops are typically created in the form of slides/presentations along with an interactive activity in which students can apply the knowledge that they gained throughout the presentation. Note that this interactive activity is **NOT** of the form of a "quiz" game, but rather, is an activity which allows students to critically think about and apply what they have learned.
