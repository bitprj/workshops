*Speaker notes:

Now we can start creating our project!

The first thing we need to know is how to create React components

First, create a new JS file, and its corresponding CSS file

Then we implement on the JS file first.

Go to the JS file and type in the first lines, they are always

```js
import React from 'react'
import './ComponentName.css'
```

and you can Import other components from other files if necessary.



Then we can create a new class - 

(What is a class, why to create a class)
