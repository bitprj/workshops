Here are some General React Tips when you use React later on

### Any changes to a program must be changed using state

- This includes things such as input boxes or forms

### Use a singular App component that displays all of your pages depending on state

- Use if statements to return different components in your `render()`

### Plan out your project design BEFORE you write code

- This helps you stay organized and creates a common theme

### You can add your own backend code to your React Website

- Because everyone has a different preference, I will leave this up to you to figure out on your own, but this [tutorial](https://codeburst.io/creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-python-npm-webpack-and-react-8925800503d9) starts you off on how to add python to react.

### Ask for help!
