*Speaker notes: 

To make you website appear on the screen, the first thing you need to do is to create an `index.js` file in the `src` directory

First, Import these two modules

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
```

And you can import any relevant components from your `src` folder

Note that a Proper practice is to import an App.js file that has a render() for all of your components

```js
import { App } from './App.js'
```
