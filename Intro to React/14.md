One feature of React is using "props"

1. What are "props"?

Props stands for properties, they are how we can parameter pass with React

Any JS code can become a prop

- Functions, variables, etc

Props allow us to communicate to other components

- For example, it can tell a picture w/ caption component to render a certain picture and give it a caption
