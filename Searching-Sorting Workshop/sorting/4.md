** Speaker's notes** :

Bubble Sort is considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The name comes from the fact that this method compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they're not in order. This makes larger values "bubble to the top" (to the very end of the list), giving us a fully sorted list in the end.
