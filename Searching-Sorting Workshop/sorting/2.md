** Speaker's notes** :

When a program takes in data, a lot of times we need to have the data be in some kind of order before being able to use it. Think of the last time you bought something online. You probably used different criteria to search for something whether that was by price, rating, size, or some other category. 

Behind the scenes a program is putting each object in order depending on your desired criteria. This is where sorting comes in. When humans manually categorize something such as a deck of cards, each person may choose to do so in a different style. Some may search for the aces, then the twos and so on or some may sort them by suit first. While there is no wrong way to arrive at a sorted sequence, there is a difference in efficiency between methods.
