** Title: ** Graphs


** Content** :

A graph in computer science is a visual representation of a set of nodes that are connected together by edges, and graphs allow us to view information and relationships in data structures.

** Speaker's notes** :


What can we do with graphs? Graph traversal, or graph search, is the process of visiting each vertex in a graph. This is important because, as we traverse through a graph, we can change or update each vertex that is visited, which can be very useful!

How can we store graphs? Graphs can be stored in lists and matrices, and for instance, the two most commonly-used methods to store a graph are in an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is an array that notes each node with the vertices that are directly connected, or adjacent, to it by an edge, and an adjacency matrix is a matrix that notes which nodes are adjacent to each other with a "1" (if the nodes are not adjacent, then this is noted by a "0").
