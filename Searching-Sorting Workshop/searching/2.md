Suppose, for example, I love watching movies. I have collections of all of the *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *James Bond* films. I have invited some friends to binge-watch them with me tomorrow morning, but I woke up late and need to find the movies quickly! How can I find the movies that I want to watch in the most efficient manner possible, before the doorbell rings?

Now extend this problem to wide-scale computer systems. What if we needed to find certain information (say, for example, medical records) from stored data in a timely fashion? What sort of algorithms should we implement? Luckily, Computer Scientists have developed answers for us!
