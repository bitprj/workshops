** Content** :

*Best explained with visuals*
Just use visuals here and let the presenter explain binary search, many wordings in the slidies may cause confusion.

** Speaker's notes** :

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
