```python
def BFS(self, s): 
  #1st breakdown
  visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  #2nd breakdown
  queue = [] 
  #3rd breakdown
  queue.append(s) 
  visited[s] = True
  #4th breakdown
  while queue:  
	s = queue.pop(0) 
	print (s, end = " ")
        #5th breakdown
        for i in self.graph[s]: 
		if visited[i] == False: 
			queue.append(i) 
			visited[i] = True
```
