** Title: ** DFS


** Content** :

The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.


- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.
