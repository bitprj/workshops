** Content** :

```python
	def DFSUtil(self, v, visited): 
    
        #first breakdown
		visited[v] = True
		print(v, end = ' ') 
    
    #second breakdown
    for i in self.graph[v]: 
			if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
            
    #third breakdown 
  def DFS(self, v): 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited)       
```
