#### Rotating the Enemy

* Spinning enemy?!!!

![]()

* rotationSpeed!

```js
// in the setup function...
enemy.addImage(enemyImage)
enemy.rotationSpeed = 4.0
```

Your game should now look pretty much identical to our target GIF. Rock on
:punch:.

Feel free to customize the enemy's rotation speed to make it faster/slower!
