### Adding the Player

* Initialize in setup()
  * Global - can access anywhere in this js file

```js
var player
```

* In the middle of the canvas in 50x50 square

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(250, 250)
  player = createSprite(width / 2, height, 50, 50)
}
```

* createSprite is a placeholder

* Coordinate system
  * Upper left is (0, 0)

* `drawSprites`
  * Display player

```js
function draw() {
  background(0, 0, 100)
  drawSprites()
}
```

* See it in action by saving and refreshing!

* Readjusting the position

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(250, 250)
  player = createSprite(width / 2, height - 25, 50, 50)
}
```

* NICE!
