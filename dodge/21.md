## Part IV. Hacking

- Isn't it a bit sad that there's a lose condition, but no win condition? Not
  even a score counter for number of enemies dodged?
- Speaking of that, what if the objective of the game was to catch all the
  enemies instead of dodging them?
- What if the enemies didn't drop straight down, but instead bounced around the
  screen? Hah! Good luck dodging that!
- What if there were levels in which both the enemies and player got faster and
  faster?
- Did you find it hard to restart the game because you had to switch from
  clicking to frantically mashing arrow keys to dodging the first enemy? Might
  it be better instead to use a key to restart the game? Or, might it be better to
  randomize the initial position to better your chances of survival? (Hint, we've
  already used the relevant functions in this workshop!)
- Right now we have a dinosaur (our beloved mascot, Prophet Orpheus) that's
  avoiding asteroids in space. What if we made the game look like an RPG, where
  a hero is avoiding arrows that are being shot at them? Or something completely
  different? Good places to find free graphics for games are

  attribution to the creators though!

Infinite possibilities await you! [p5.js
documentation](http://p5js.org/reference/) is a great resource, and can help you
fulfill all of your wildest ambitions for this game!
