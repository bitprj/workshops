So now you have to put an **image** of him into your game, like you did in the [Personal Website](https://github.com/bitprj/workshops/blob/f87c9df02bb2ef02e614d50eea6467efd890612f/personal_website) workshop. To add an image, we use:

```html
<img src="[URL]">
```

When you're done, you should see Bigfoot in the live preview, like this:

[![img](https://github.com/bitprj/workshops/raw/f87c9df02bb2ef02e614d50eea6467efd890612f/find_bigfoot/img/bigfoot_image.png)](https://github.com/bitprj/workshops/blob/f87c9df02bb2ef02e614d50eea6467efd890612f/find_bigfoot/img/bigfoot_image.png)

And the `index.html` file looks like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <img src="bigfoot.png">
  </body>
</html>
```
