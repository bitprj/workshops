<<One column text>>

Just like how we ran code when someone clicked using `onclick`, we're going to call a function once the page has loaded with `onload`. You can look this up by Googling "on page load". Lets go ahead and make a script tag for our new function in the JavaScript file, `script.js`:

```javascript
function loadBigFoot() {}
```
