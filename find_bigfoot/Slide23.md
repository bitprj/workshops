### Setting Bigfoot's Location

That's much better! But the top left corner is a pretty boring place to hide Bigfoot. Can you figure out how to set Bigfoot's **position** to somewhere else? This one is harder, and may take some trial and error, but it's really worth the effort to see if you can figure it out yourself. Afterwards, Bigfoot's position will be somewhere in the middle of the forest, rather than the top left corner, like this:

OK, got it working? If you need help, try asking your neighbor or workshop leader for hints.
