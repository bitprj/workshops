<<One column text>>

It looks like when you run `alert("I am an alert box!");` it opens a pop-up box showing the text inside the quotes. So if we put 2 and 2 together, our `img` tag should look like this:

```html
<img src="bigfoot.png" onclick="alert("Woohoo, you win! You found Bigfoot!");">
```

Change your `img` tag to look like that too, then click Bigfoot in the live preview.
