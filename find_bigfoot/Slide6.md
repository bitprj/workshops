### Taking Bigfoot Out of His Natural Habitat

It is rumored that Bigfoot's natural habitat is a forest in the Pacific Northwest. What happens if you take him out of his natural habitat and stick him on a computer screen? Would he scream? Would he rip up the computer?

Luckily for you, we've done the hard part of wrangling him out of the jungle and putting him in captivity on the Internet, and Bigfoot can be found in your repl.it project :)
