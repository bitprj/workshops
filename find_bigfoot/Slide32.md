<<One column text>>

Now look at how we positioned bigfoot in the css file. We have two numbers: Bigfoot's position from the top and his position from the left. Therefore, those are the two numbers that have to be random so he can move around. Try and google and figure out a way to generate a random number.

There’s a couple different ways to solve this, but we googled “generate a random number in javascript” and went to the first result, which told us to use `Math.random()`
