<<One column text>>

Now, lets get a hold of the `img` tag and change its `src` to our friend Bigfoot.

```javascript
function loadBigFoot() {
  document.getElementById('bigFoot').src = 'bigfoot.png'
}
```

Bigfoot should now load after the background. We did it!

Feel free to experiment with the `left` and `top` values to find a good place to hide Bigfoot.
