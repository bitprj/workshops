<<One column text>>

When you are done, or if you are simply really stuck, we've included a sample solution below. (But there are other ways to add the background image, so if your solution doesn't match mine, that's OK.)

Sample solution, in `style.css`:

```css
body {
  background-image: url('/forest.jpg');
}
```
