<<One column text>>

There are several ways to add the background image. Here is one way:

1. Google `html background image`.
2. The first link brings you here: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp
3. There is an example near the top. You can click "Try it yourself" to see the full HTML of the example.
4. Open the `style.css` file like in the example, but replace the URL with the picture of the forest. You do not need the background-color rule since we are already setting a background image.
5. Remember to link your CSS file to your HTML file!
