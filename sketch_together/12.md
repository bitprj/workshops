**What is a JavaScript Object?**

Take the object closest to you right now, for most of you that might be a cell phone. A cell phone can have a lot of characteristics, or _properties_. One could be a screen.

How would you describe a screen to someone who hasn't seen it before? You can tell them how big that screen is. JavaScript objects are bundles of information stored in this way: a property and a value. What would a JavaScript object of our phone look like?

```js
var phone = {
  screenSize: '5.5 inches'
}
```
