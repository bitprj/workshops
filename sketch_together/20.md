### Displaying the Points

Next, we'll want to display the points that we've requested from Firebase, by moving through the `points` array and drawing an ellipse at each point:

```js
function draw() {
  for (var i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
    var point = points[i]
    ellipse(point.x, point.y, 5, 5)
  }
}
```
