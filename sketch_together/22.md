Now let's add functionality to be able to click and draw, and have the points that we've drawn be updated in Firebase.

We'll first create a function after the draw function that takes the mouse x and y position and pushes that information to Firebase:

```js
function draw() {
  // ...the rest of the draw function
}

function drawPoint() {
  pointsData.push({ x: mouseX, y: mouseY })
}
```

[`mouseX`](https://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseX) and [`mouseY`](https://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseY) are provided by p5.js.
