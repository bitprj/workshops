See how similar it looks to the `config` object we have in our `script.js`? The `apiKey` is a unique property to _your_ `config` object that lets Firebase know who is accessing your app's database.

```js
var config = {
  apiKey: 'AIxaSyGsAkHke9lXEU_97a8rYpMn7gOH3eWDxrM'
  // ...other stuff
}
```

The first thing we've added to the object is a `property` named `apiKey`, which we assigned a jumbled value of text to. To access this value, we can write:

```js
config.apiKey
```
