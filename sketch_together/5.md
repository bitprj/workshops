Once you have signed up click on the "Get Started" button, which will load up out [Firebase dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Here we will create a new project, which we will name `collaborative-sketch`.

Let's click on "Add Firebase to your web app". Once you register your app with a nickname, it will give you a code snippet. We'll copy _part_ of the code snippet and paste it into our `script.js`. Keep in mind your URLs and variables will be different, and that's fine!

```js
var config = {
  apiKey: 'AIxaSyGsAkHke9lXEU_97a8rYpMn7gOH3eWDxrM',
  authDomain: 'collaborative-sketch.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://collaborative-sketch.firebaseio.com',
  storageBucket: 'collaborative-sketch.appspot.com'
}
firebase.initializeApp(config)
```
