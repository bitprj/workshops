## Part III: Odds and Ends

The last part of this workshop is including some nice features. We'll add two buttons: one to save the drawing that's been made, and one to delete the drawing.

In our `index.html`, we'll create a sort of control panel, with a `div` containing our two buttons:

```html
<body>
  <div id="controls">
    <button id="saveDrawing">Save to Computer</button>
    <button id="clearDrawing">DELETE DRAWING</button>
  </div>

  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.3.0/firebase.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.1/p5.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
```

In our `main.js`, we'll create the functionality behind these two buttons, and then attach it to the HTML elements using jQuery. Add this code below everything else in your `main.js`

```js
function drawPointIfMousePressed() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    drawPoint()
  }
}

$('#saveDrawing').on('click', saveDrawing)

function saveDrawing() {}

$('#clearDrawing').on('click', clearDrawing)

function clearDrawing() {}
```

How do we define these functions? Well, we've already seen how to save our canvas -- using the `saveCanvas()` function offered by p5.js! Let's fill in our `saveDrawing()` function:

```js
function saveDrawing() {
  saveCanvas()
}
```

And what of our `clearDrawing()` function? Well, first, we should remove everything currently stored in our Firebase app, and then we should wipe our `points` array:

```js
function clearDrawing() {
  pointsData.remove()
  points = []
}
```

Right now other screens won't clear when we remove the drawing from Firebase. To fix this, add the following:

```js
function setup() {
  // ...the rest of the setup function
  pointsData.on('child_added', function(point) {
    points.push(point.val())
  })
  pointsData.on('child_removed', function() {
    points = []
  })

  canvas.mousePressed(drawPoint)
  canvas.mouseMoved(drawPointIfMousePressed)
}
```

Congratulations! Your collaborative drawing app is now complete.
