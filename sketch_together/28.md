The last part of this workshop is including some nice features. We'll add two buttons: one to save the drawing that's been made, and one to delete the drawing.

In our `index.html`, we'll create a sort of control panel, with a `div` containing our two buttons:

```html
<body>
  <div id="controls">
    <button id="saveDrawing">Save to Computer</button>
    <button id="clearDrawing">DELETE DRAWING</button>
  </div>
