How do we define these functions? Well, we've already seen how to save our canvas -- using the `saveCanvas()` function offered by p5.js! Let's fill in our `saveDrawing()` function:

```js
function saveDrawing() {
  saveCanvas()
}
```

And what of our `clearDrawing()` function? Well, first, we should remove everything currently stored in our Firebase app, and then we should wipe our `points` array:

```js
function clearDrawing() {
  pointsData.remove()
  points = []
}
```
