## Part II: The JS File Continued 

### Keeping Track of the Points

Beneath that, we'll add our functions, `setup()` and `draw()`:

```js
var config = {
  // stuff hidden here for simplicity
}
firebase.initializeApp(config)

var pointsData = firebase.database().ref()

function setup() {}

function draw() {}
```

Then, within the `setup()` function, we'll create a canvas and paint the background. Here, we're creating a 400 by 400 canvas and coloring the background white:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
}
```

We'll also set the fill to black, so that the ellipses we draw will be filled in black:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  fill(0)
}
```

### Syncing to Firebase

Next, we'll create an array to store the points that have been drawn on the canvas so far. Let's put this line above the `setup()` function:

```js
var pointsData = firebase.database().ref()
var points = []

function setup() {
  // ...the rest of the setup function
}
```

We'll need some way to get data from Firebase and into our `points` array, so let's add a call to Firebase at the end of `setup()`:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  fill(0)

  pointsData.on('child_added', function(point) {
    points.push(point.val())
  })
}
```

You'll notice that we've created a function at the same time that we're passing it as an argument. This function does not have a name, and is not stored anywhere. It exists only to be passed as an argument to `.on()`. This is called an anonymous function.

It would be equivalent if we had declared a function, perhaps named `addPointToPointsArray`, and then passed that in as our argument to `.on()`.

Now our `script.js` should look like this:

```js
var config = {
  apiKey: 'AIxaSyGsAkHke9lXEU_97a8rYpMn7gOH3eWDxrM',
  authDomain: 'collaborative-sketch.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://collaborative-sketch.firebaseio.com',
  storageBucket: 'collaborative-sketch.appspot.com'
}
firebase.initializeApp(config)

var pointsData = firebase.database().ref()

var points = []

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  fill(0)
  pointsData.on('child_added', function(point) {
    points.push(point.val())
  })
}

function draw() {}
```
