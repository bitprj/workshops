### Setting up the Files

Head on over to Repl.it which is the online IDE we are using and spin up a new [HTML repl](https://repl.it/languages/html)

Next, clear the contents of `index.html` and put the following in its place:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Collaborative Sketch!</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
