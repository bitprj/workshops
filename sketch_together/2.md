## Part I: Set-up

### Setting up the Files

Head on over to Repl.it whcih is the online IDE we are using and spin up a new [HTML repl](https://repl.it/languages/html)

Next, clear the contents of `index.html` and put the following in its place:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Collaborative Sketch!</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

And we'll add script tags for Firebase, p5.js, jQuery, and our own `script.js` file within our `body`.

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.3.0/firebase.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.1/p5.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

### Setting up the Firebase App

Firebase is a real-time database. This means that whenever one person edits the sketch, the sketch on everyone else's computer or phone will update!

Before we can start coding, we need to sign up on the Firebase website. Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and sign up for an account.

Now that we're at our dashboard, we'll create our app. Let's head over to our [Firebase dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project, which we will name `collaborative-sketch`.

Let's click on "Add Firebase to your web app." We'll copy _part_ of the code snippet and paste it into our `script.js`. Keep in mind your URLs and variables will be different, and that's fine!

```js
var config = {
  apiKey: 'AIxaSyGsAkHke9lXEU_97a8rYpMn7gOH3eWDxrM',
  authDomain: 'collaborative-sketch.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://collaborative-sketch.firebaseio.com',
  storageBucket: 'collaborative-sketch.appspot.com'
}
firebase.initializeApp(config)
```

After copying the code snippet above, head back to Firebase and select the `Auth` tab on the left-hand side. Select `SET UP SIGN-IN METHOD` from the top menu bar, and click `ADD DOMAIN`. Enter `repl.co` and click `ADD`.

Next, go to the `Database` tab on the left-hand side. Within the `Database` tab, we're going to select `Rules`. Here we'll set database permissions for reading and writing to `true`.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

Click `Publish` to save your changes. You should see this warning at the top of your page -- don't worry about it:

We'll now head back to our `script.js` file. Below the Firebase configuration, we'll add a variable `pointsData` that we can use to access Firebase.

```js
firebase.initializeApp(config)

var pointsData = firebase.database().ref()
```
