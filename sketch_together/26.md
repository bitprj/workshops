That's not _quite_ right, because we want to execute `drawPoint()`, but only if `mouseIsPressed` is true.

We could write a separate function right under `drawPoint`:

```js
function drawPoint() {
  // ...the rest of the drawPoint function
}

function drawPointIfMousePressed() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    drawPoint()
  }
}
```
