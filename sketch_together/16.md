Then, within the `setup()` function, we'll create a canvas and paint the background. Here, we're creating a 400 by 400 canvas and coloring the background white:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
}
```

We'll also set the fill to black, so that the ellipses we draw will be filled in black:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  fill(0)
}
```
