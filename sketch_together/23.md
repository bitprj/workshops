We don't even have to draw ellipses directly in these functions, because that'll be taken care of by the `.on()` handler that we have in `setup()`, which will get our newly created points from Firebase and add them to the `points` array, which will then be drawn by `draw()`.

Next, we'll set up our functions to detect clicking and dragging. Normally we would use `mousePressed()` and `mouseDragged()`, but we want to restrict the event handling to the canvas. We don't want to send mouse data to Firebase if the clicking isn't happening within the canvas.

So instead, we'll be detecting mouse activity with one of the canvas's methods. In order to call a method of canvas, we must store our canvas in a variable. Alter the `createCanvas()` line in `setup()`:

```diff
- createCanvas(400, 400);
+ var canvas = createCanvas(400, 400);
```

And then we can use the `.mousePressed()` method, and pass in our previously created `drawPoint()` function as an argument. This means that `drawPoint()` will be executed when there is a mouse pressed on the canvas.
