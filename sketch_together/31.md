Right now other screens won't clear when we remove the drawing from Firebase. To fix this, add the following:

```js
function setup() {
  // ...the rest of the setup function
  pointsData.on('child_added', function(point) {
    points.push(point.val())
  })
  pointsData.on('child_removed', function() {
    points = []
  })

  canvas.mousePressed(drawPoint)
  canvas.mouseMoved(drawPointIfMousePressed)
}
```

Congratulations! Your collaborative drawing app is now complete.
