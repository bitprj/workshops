And then use it:

```diff
- canvas.mouseMoved(drawPoint);
+ canvas.mouseMoved(drawPointIfMousePressed);
```

Now, if we save and refresh live preview (opened with `preview` > `live preview`), we'll be able to draw stuff. Then, if we link the URL of our external live preview to a friend, we'll be able to see what they're drawing as well! Awesome!

Now that something somewhat works, let's make it official by committing and pushing! See if you remember the commands to use.

Once you have pushed, remember to add `USERNAME.github.io` to the list of Authorized Domains on your Firebase app. After that, your project should be live on `USERNAME.github.io/collaborative_sketch/`! To see how to add an authorized domain, go to [Setting up the Firebase App](#setting-up-the-firebase-app).
