We also want `drawPoint()` to be called when we drag our mouse, but there is no `.mouseDragged()` method. So we'll make our own, out of the `mouseIsPressed` p5.js property, and the canvas method `.mouseMoved()`. If `mouseIsPressed` is true during `.mouseMoved()`, that means our mouse is being dragged!

We can start by adding this beneath `canvas.mousePressed(drawPoint);`:

```js
function setup() {
  // ...the rest of the setup function
  canvas.mousePressed(drawPoint)
  canvas.mouseMoved(drawPoint)
}
```
