The `.` is a special character that allows us to look inside of an `object`. This can be used as a shortcut to replacing code, so writing `config.apiKey` is many times equivalent to writing the full jumbled text `"AIxaSyGsAkHke9lXEU_97a8rYpMn7gOH3eWDxrM"`.

In the same manner, `config.authDomain` would look inside to the `object` for the value of `authDomain` and become "replaced" by `"collab-draw.firebaseapp.com"`.

Can anybody guess what this line replaces?

```js
config.databaseURL
```
