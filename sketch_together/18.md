We'll need some way to get data from Firebase and into our `points` array, so let's add a call to Firebase at the end of `setup()`:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  fill(0)

  pointsData.on('child_added', function(point) {
    points.push(point.val())
  })
}
```

You'll notice that we've created a function at the same time that we're passing it as an argument. This function does not have a name, and is not stored anywhere. It exists only to be passed as an argument to `.on()`. This is called an anonymous function.

It would be equivalent if we had declared a function, perhaps named `addPointToPointsArray`, and then passed that in as our argument to `.on()`.
