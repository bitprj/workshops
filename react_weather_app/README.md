# styled-components

Here is a final [demo](https://shmishtopher.github.io/styled-components-workshop/) of this workshop, along with the [source code](https://github.com/shmishtopher/styled-components-workshop) used to make it.

[`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/) is a library that creates styled [React](https://reactjs.org/) components in a clean, idiomatic way. In this workshop, we'll use `styled-components` to create a small weather app that pulls data from the free [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) API. This workshop uses the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler, but you can use any bundler you wish (Webpack, Rollup, etc.). This workshop assumes that you have a recent version of node and npm installed.

## Setup

In your command line, navigate to wherever you keep your projects and create a new directory with `mkdir styled-weather` and `cd styled-weather`. Run `npm init` and follow the prompts, fill out the fields with whatever you want.

Next, we need to install our libraries:

```bash
npm i react react-dom styled-components --save
npm i parcel-bundler --save-dev
```

Now, in the `"scripts"` field of `package.json`, add the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "parcel src/index.html",
  "start": "parcel src/index.html",
  "build": "parcel build src/index.html"
},
```

These will enable `npm start` to call the parcel bundler to package and serve our app on port 1234. You can override the port number with `-p <number>`.

Create a new subdirectory call `src` in `styled-weather`, and create the files `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`, `animation.js`, and one more subdirectory named `components`.

### `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" />
    <title>Hacker Skies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### `index.css`

```css
html,
body,
#root {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  background: #fdfbfb;
  background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, #fdfbfb 0%, #ebedee 100%);
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #333;
}
```

### `index.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { App } from './components/App'

export const secretKey = '<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
export const getCoords = cb => navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(cb)
export const baseurl =
  'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.darksky.net/forecast/'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### Getting a Secret Key

Navigate to [darksky.net/dev](https://darksky.net/dev/) and create a free developer account. This will give you access to the dark sky API for free (up to 1000 free requests per day). You can generate or re-generate your `secret key` on the "console" page located at ([darksky.net/dev/account](https://darksky.net/dev/account)). Replace the provided key with `<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>` in `index.js`.

### Running the App

Test the app by running `npm start` and navigating to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). You should see an error, as `App` is a component that does not yet exist.

## Components

React apps (along with `styled-components`) are built with the idea of components, which are pieces of your application that encapsulate all their own stuffâ€”their data, state, styling, subcomponents. Components can then be composed together to create complex UIs..

We'll keep all of our components in our `components` subdirectory. There are two types of components used in this workshop, stateful and stateless/functional. A stateful component has internal data, and it updates every time its data changes. A stateless component does not maintain any internal state, rather it renders based on the properties that are passed to it.

### `components/App.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { secretKey, getCoords, baseurl } from '../index'
import { Loading } from './Loading'
import { Weather } from './Weather'
import { Card } from './Card'

export class App extends Component {
  state = {
    isLoading: true,
    requested: null
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    getCoords(({ coords }) => {
      fetch(`${baseurl}${secretKey}/${coords.latitude},${coords.longitude}`)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(dat => dat.currently)
        .then(requested => {
          this.setState({ isLoading: false, requested })
        })
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Card>
        {this.state.isLoading ? <Loading>Loading...</Loading> : null}
        {this.state.requested ? <Weather dat={this.state.requested} /> : null}
      </Card>
    )
  }
}
```

This component serves as the "container" for our entire application. It manages the state of the whole application. The two pieces of state that this application uses is `isLoading` and `requested`. `requested` stores the result of our API call, and `isLoading` tells us weather the API request has completed yet. `componentDidMount` is a component [lifecycle hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) that triggers once, right after the component is mounted to the DOM, which makes it the perfect place to put our API request. The dark sky API exposes a `/forecast` endpoint, which responds with a simple JSON object. After parsing the JSON with `res => res.json()`, we filter the data and updates the components state. Calling `setState()` will queue a re-render of the `App` component, which will switch from our `loading` state to our `weather` state.

### `animation.js`

```js
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'

export const FadeRight = keyframes`
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(10px)
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0px)
  }
`

export const FadeLeft = keyframes`
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-10px)
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0px)
  }
`

export const FadeUp = keyframes`
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(10px)
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0px)
  }
`
```

This is not a true component, so it does not belong in the `/components` directory. The `styled-components` library provides a `keyframes` function, which will enable us to define CSS animation keyframes right in our application code. Here we define three separate animations: `FadeRight`, `FadeLeft`, and `FadeUp`. Each of these is an entrance that we will use to reveal some data in our app.

### `components/Card.js`

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const Card = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  max-width: 300px;
  max-height: 512px;
  background: #fff;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: center;

  @media (min-width: 500px) {
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);
  }
`
```

The `Card` component just serves as a container for our other components, so it doesn't need to read any properties or maintain any state. The `styled.div` function will return a new `React` component with the styles in the template literal. You can use any standard CSS properties in the template string.

### `components/Detail.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { FadeUp } from '../animation'

const Container = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: center;

  margin-top: auto;
  animation: ${FadeUp} 1s ease-out 0s;
  font-size: 16px;
`

const Row = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  height: 32px;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
`

export const Details = ({ wSpeed, humid, wGust, cover }) => (
  <Container>
    <Row>
      <span>Wind Speed: {wSpeed}</span>
      Humidity: {humid}
      <span />
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <span>Wind Gust: {wGust}</span>
      Cloud Cover: {cover}
      <span />
    </Row>
  </Container>
)
```

This is a stateless component, it simply renders any properties passed to it. To position all four fields, we use two `styled-components` with the flexbox property. We also import our `FadeUp` animation so that we can use it in the `Container` component.

### `components/Loading.js`

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const Loading = styled.p`
  margin-top: auto;
  margin-bottom: auto;
`
```

This is likely the most basic `styled-component` you will ever encounter. Because its parent uses `display: flex`, we can use `auto` margins to vertically center the element on the card.

### `components/Summary.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { FadeLeft } from '../animation'

const Large = styled.p`
  font-size: 24px;
  animation: ${FadeLeft} 0.5s ease-out 0s;
  text-align: center;
`

export const Summary = ({ weather }) => <Large>{weather}</Large>
```

This component could have exported a single styled component instead of exporting a functional component. This example demonstrates how we can simplify our react code by using `styled-components`, as they have all the boilerplate abstracted away into a collection of idiomatic functions. (like, `styled.div` or `styled.p`, which create `div` and `p` elements respectively).

### `components/Temperature.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { FadeRight } from '../animation'

const Large = styled.p`
  font-size: 32px;
  animation: ${FadeRight} 0.5s ease-out 0s;
  text-align: center;
`

export const Temperature = ({ temp }) => (
  <Large>
    {temp}
    Â°F
  </Large>
)
```

This component functions nearly identically to the [`Summary`](#componentssummaryjs) component. The one advantage to passing a property instead of listing the temperature inline with a pure styled component is that it allows for cleaner code on in the `Weather` component. (It abstracts away the appending of "Â°F").

### `components/Weather.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { Temperature } from './Temperature'
import { Summary } from './Summary'
import { Details } from './Details'

const Container = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: center;
`

export const Weather = ({ dat }) => (
  <Container>
    <Temperature temp={dat.temperature} />
    <Summary weather={dat.summary} />
    <Details
      wSpeed={dat.windSpeed}
      wGust={dat.windGust}
      humid={dat.humidity}
      cover={dat.cloudCover}
    />
  </Container>
)
```

This component renders the app after we receive data from the Dark Sky's API. It takes data passed to it (through properties) and routs it to the proper components for rendering. Once this component is completed, you should be able to bundle and run your app (with `npm start`) error free. The completed app should look like this:

![app](img/completed_app.png)

## Challenges

1. Create a production build with `npm run build`
2. Add a "dark mode" (hint: you can pass props to `styled-components`)
3. Toggle to Celsius on click (hint: convert `Temperature.js` into a stateful component, and add an `onClick` method that modifies state)
4. Add a refresh button
