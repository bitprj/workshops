# Adding Styles to the Stylesheet
### Resize the Image

```css
img {
  width: 200px;
}
```

- A CSS stylesheet contains "rules," each of which consists of a selector, and attributes and values within brackets, known as a "declaration block".

[for speaker]<> Now that we've linked our CSS file to our HTML file, let's write some CSS to resize the image.

In our case, the selector is `img`. This merely selects all image tags (and thus, all images). The rule then says to set the `width` (width) of all things selected (in our case, all the images) to `200px`. `px` refers to pixels, which are a unit of measurement on the screen. When this rule is applied, all the images on our page will have a width of 200 pixels.
