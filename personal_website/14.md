# Adding Text to the Body
If your description was a few paragraphs, or had line breaks, cut them by placing each paragraph in its own `<p></p>`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Prophet Orpheus</h1>
    <p>Coder Dino</p>
    <p>Will code for food</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If your description was a few paragraphs, or had line breaks, you may have noticed that one `<p></p>` doesn't quite cut it. Adding extra blank lines or spaces between words in HTML does not change the spacing of the content. We can solve this by placing each paragraph in its own `<p></p>`.

Run your `index.html` and refresh the Live Preview. Yay!
