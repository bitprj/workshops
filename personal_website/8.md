# HTML
- HTML works by storing information inside tags. 
- Inside `<html></html>`, we've placed two other sets of tags: `<head></head>`  and `<body></body>` 

- `<body></body>` wraps around the "body". It holds everything you would see in the actual tab/window when you open the page, 

- `<head></head>`wraps around the "head". It conveys information about the page to the browser.

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser what version of HTML to expect.

[for speaker]<> Before proceeding, we'll briefly go over what our template means.

HTML works by storing information inside tags. `<html></html>` is an example of one such tag. Inside `<html></html>`, we've placed two other sets of tags: `<head></head>` (which wraps around the "head") and `<body></body>` (which wraps around the "body"). The body holds everything you would see in the actual tab/window when you open the page, while the head conveys information about the page to the browser.

`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser what version of HTML to expect. Since it is a language, HTML is constantly growing and updating, so there are multiple versions. In our case, we are going to use HTML5, the latest version.
