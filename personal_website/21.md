# Link the CSS file in the HTML

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```
- Type this into the head of `index.html` (between `<head>` and `</head>`)

- `<link />` is the link tag, which describes relationships between the current file and some external file.

- `rel="stylesheet"` specifies what this relationship is,
- `href` (hypertext reference) specifies where the file can be found

[for speaker]<> Although we have a CSS file, until we explicitly tell the HTML file to use the CSS file, it will not use it. We must explicitly link the CSS file in the HTML. We'll do this by typing the following into the head of `index.html` (between `<head>` and `</head>`), because the head is where we tell information about the page to the browser.

`<link />` is the link tag, which describes relationships between the current file (in this case, `index.html`), and some external file (`style.css`). In our example, `rel="stylesheet"` specifies what this relationship is, i.e., that `style.css` is a stylesheet, and `href` (hypertext reference) specifies where the file can be found (in this case, it's just the filename `style.css`). The link tag, similar to the image tag, is a self-closing tag, once again denoted by the `/` that precedes the `>`.
