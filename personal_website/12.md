As mentioned before, all information is wrapped in tags. Tags are predefined in the language; think of them as the words in the language. For text, HTML provides a number of tags to store text. We'll be using two of the most basic ones: the h1 tag (`<h1>`) and the paragraph tag (`<p>`). The h1 tag is the first in a series of heading tags, with `h1` being the highest ranking, and `h6` being the lowest ranking. Just as with the other tags, you can place information within the these tags by surrounding your content with an opening and closing tag.
