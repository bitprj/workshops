**Title:** *Making your website appear on screen*

upper text box:

* Render your project
* `<App />`

lower text box:

```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

*Speaker notes: 

We also need to render our project to make it appear on screen.

We can use the code

```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Notice that

- `<App />` is a component that displays your website
- `<App />` can be changed to any component that is created in index.js, or is imported
