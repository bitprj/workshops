Some first steps with React:

you can open project folder using a code editor you like. I recommend VS Code, but any other editor works as well.

We can also edit the `index.html` file: First, we need to go to the `public` directory, and start to edit the `index.html` file. You can create a `<title>` inside  `<head>` or add new fonts if needed

Then we can change the favicon. For example, replace `favicon.ico` with your own, and X-Icon can make any image a favicon! This may take a little while to update on localhost, so don't worry if it is not showing up right after you made the change.

We can go to the `src` directory, and delete everything in the `src` directory, or you can just modify the files if you would like.
