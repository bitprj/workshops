**Title:** *Create a new project in React*

upper-right text box:

* Make a new directory

```bash
$ mkdir MyWebsite
$ cd MyWebsite
```

lower-right text box:

* Create a new React Project

```bash
$ npx create-react-app [Project Name goes here]
$ cd [Project name]
$ npm start
```

------

*Speaker notes: 

Now we can create a new React Project. But before that, we can create a new directory using `mkdir`, and use `cd` command to go to your new directory

Then we can create a new Project

And a new localhost window should pop up with the default project
