*Speaker notes: 

Although JSX is like HTML, there are still some differences

Some things are different from HTML

- `class` is a reserved word in JS, so you must use `className` instead
- The `style` attribute must be passed a JS object, more on that in [How to Use CSS](#how-to-use-css)

You can insert JS code into JSX tags!

- Wrap the variable around curly braces `{}`
- Works for attributes and inner HTML!

You can insert Components with JSX

- Just use `<ComponentName />`
