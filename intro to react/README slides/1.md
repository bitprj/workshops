Are you guys familiar with theses words? "JavaScript, HTML and CSS"? Before we start to learn React, you need to at least have some knowledge of what these are and how to use them.

You should also understand how to access development tools.

Besides these, you should be interested in being able to solve problems and starting to learn hacking.
